This code allows you to book movies, serving as a movie booking website but without the website (it outputs in the terminal). 
The information is stored in SQL.
This code needs 4 tables in sql. 1 for storing users, 1 for movies, 1 for food_menu, 1 for bookings.


The below picture is the users table
